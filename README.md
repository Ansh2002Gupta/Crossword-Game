## ABOUT THE GAME
It is a 2D game that is based on the theme of word searching in a grid having alphabets arranged all around. Amongst these heck of alphabets our task is to find words that can be arranged in any direction.

## How to Play?
<ol>
  <li>The players will first of all select the level that they prefer to play, depending upon which they would enter some words. 
  <li>In return they would be given a wordweb. 
  <li>All the words would be arranged in any one of  the eight directions:- 
    <ul>
      <li>up
      <li>down
      <li>left
      <li>right
      <li>up-diagonal-right
      <li>up-diagonal-left
      <li>down-diagonal-right
      <li>down-diagonal-left
     </ul>
   <li>Players will fetch for all the words in the time alloted to them. 
   <li>Note: Do press enter after every selection of a word, each selection will be indicated by yellow color, whereas wrong ones by red color leading to deduction in score. 
   <li>Your right answer will be indicated by different colors. 
   <li>For every correct answer '+5' points be awarded while for every wrong click '-2' point will be deducted. 
   <li>A time-bonus of '+0.5' points will be given on finishing the game before time (stop the timer as you finish).
</ol>

## Special Features
<ul>
  <li> Autofill Button:-<br>  Somewhere in the game you will be required to input some words depending on the instructions given, that you will be searching for and will be hidden in the grid by my program. So that every time the user doesn't get bore by again and again entering the words, I introduced a 'autofill' feature of words for the user. These words are fetched from the database built inside the program.
  <li> Timer:-<br> You might get busy amidst the play, keeping this in mind I also introduced a stopping feature of the timer. Don't worry every thing is freezed now :)
  <li> Score Card:-<br> Designing an attractive score card is a very critical step. The score card of the game shows all the details that the user might need to analyse his game.
  <li> Interative User Interface:-<br> To guide the user throughout the game play and to avoid any intended error in the code, the program communicates with the user through interactive messages wherever needed.
</ul>
